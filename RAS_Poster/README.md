# RAS Poster

## About this Folder

This folder contains the code used to generate the results in the poster I submitted for the Royal Astronomical Society Early Career Poster Competition in September 2020. The special case of y=0 was considered here. However, please note that the TXT file ```data_1000k.txt```, which contains the positions of 1 million rays on the detector (generated by Geometric Image Analysis in Zemax OpticStudio), was added to this repository as a ZIP file (```data_1000k.zip```) because the original TXT file is over 164MB. This file was used to generate the ```data_1000k_centroids.csv``` file, which contains centroids of the points in ```data_1000k.txt```, clustered using k-means. Before running the script ```simple_fit_V3_residuals.py```, please extract ```data_1000k.zip```.
