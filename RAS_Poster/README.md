# RAS Poster

This folder contains the code used to generate the results in the poster I submitted for the Royal Astronomical Society Early Career Poster Competition in September 2020. The special case of y=0 was considered here. However, please note that the file ```data_1000k.txt```, which contains the positions of 1 million rays on the detector (generated by Geometric Image Analysis in Zemax OpticStudio), was not added to this repository because the file is over 167MB. This file was used to generate the ```data_1000k_centroids.csv``` file, which contains centroids of the points in ```data_1000k.txt```, clustered using k-means.
